2. Absence of Data Collection and Processing
- The Log-it App does not require user registration and does not collect any personally identifiable information.
- All of your records (including entries, emotions, and tags) are securely stored exclusively on your device.
- We do not transmit or store any user data on external servers. The developer or any third parties cannot access your records.

3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

4. Data Management and Deletion
- All user records are stored on the device where the App is installed.
- You can edit or delete your records at any time within the App.
- Deleting the App or resetting your device will result in the permanent deletion of all data stored within the App, and this data cannot be recovered.

5. Children's Privacy
- The Log-it App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
